  <h2>Tubataha Reef</h2>
  <p>
    The Tubbataha Reef in the Sulu Sea is a marine sanctuary protected as the Tubbataha Reef National Marine Park. The reef is made up of two atolls, North Atoll and South Atoll, separated by a deep channel of approximately 5 miles (8 km) wide. It has become one of the most popular dive sites in the Philippines because of its coral walls where the shallow coral reef abruptly ends giving way to great depths. The marine park is open to live-aboard diving excursions between the months of April to June when the waves are most calm.

  <h2>Puerto Galera</h2>
  <p>
    Just south of Manila is the charming coastal town of Puerto Galera, well-favored for its gorgeous beaches, excellent diving spots and wide diversity of marine species. The most popular beaches are White Beach and Sabang Beach, which also offer nearby shopping, dining, nightlife and hotel accommodation. Another popular attraction is the natural harbor of Muelle Bay with its rows of shops, restaurants and bars. Visitors can also go snorkeling to see some of Asia’s best coral reefs or dive among old shipwrecks and hundreds of fish species.

  <h2>Donsol</h2>
  <p>
    Located in the province of Sorsogon, a place of pristine beaches, stunning waterfalls and unexplored caves, the sleepy fishing village of Donsol is the place in the Philippines to see whale sharks. The ocean’s gentle giants can be seen between November and June, with the numbers peaking between February and May. Tourists can also take a boat cruise along the Donsol River through mangrove and palm trees, and watch the night light up with millions of sparkling fireflies. If that’s not enough, a traditional shrimp-catching expedition with bamboos and nets, followed by a tasty dinner of the cooked catch is also available.

  <h2>Coron</h2>
  <p>
    Also within the gorgeous province of Palawan is the municipality of Coron. With crystal clear waters perfect for snorkelling, powdery white sandy beaches and innumerable picture-perfect landscapes, Coron is a beach bum’s dream. As in El Nido, travellers can charter a small boat or join organized tour groups for day trips around the many islands and lagoons here. One stop that should not be missed is the breathtaking Kayangan Lake, dubbed the cleanest in the country and surrounded by stunning karst walls; truly a sight to behold, both above and below the water.

  <h2>Tagaytay City</h2>
  <p>
    FWhat Manila offers in traffic, energy, and noise, Tagaytay has in relaxation, natural beauty, and solitude. Located less than 2 hours outside of Manila on a mountain overlooking Taal Lake and Volcano, Tagaytay offers mountain bed & breakfasts, beautiful views, and areas for quiet reflection. It’s like the Pacific Northwest of the Philippines, minus the hipsters.

  <h2>Batanes</h2>
  <p>
    Batanes is to the Philippines as the Azores is to Portugal. It is the island in this archipelago that’s so far north, you probably didn’t realize it was part of the Philippines. Located ~200 km from the northernmost tip of Luzon, Batanes is an island of rolling hills, historic lighthouses, and lush farmlands. Here, you can hike, explore historic buildings, or simply relax and take in the isolation of it all.
The only way to get to Batanes is to fly. Luckily, many budget carriers in the Philippines fly from both Cebu and Manila to Batanes, so you won’t be short on options for getting to the island.
